## CS-300-DSA-Analysis-Design

# What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
In this course project, the primary problem was developing a program that processes, organizes, and displays data effectively using appropriate data structures. The solution required handling complex data relationships, optimizing memory usage, and ensuring efficient data retrieval.

# How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I approached the problem by carefully selecting data structures suited to the project’s needs, focusing on both efficiency and clarity. Data structures are essential for managing data complexity and ensuring that operations like searching, sorting, and updating can be done quickly and efficiently, especially with large datasets. Choosing the right structure helped improve the program's performance and responsiveness.

# How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
When encountering challenges, such as unexpected data behavior or performance issues, I reviewed each section of code, refactored where necessary, and consulted additional resources. Testing small components individually also helped me identify and resolve specific issues. This iterative problem-solving approach allowed me to address roadblocks effectively without compromising the overall project timeline.

# How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This project broadened my approach to software design by reinforcing the importance of planning and choosing optimal structures and algorithms from the outset. It highlighted how each decision impacts the code's performance, readability, and adaptability, encouraging me to approach software development with a more analytical mindset.

# How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Through this project, I learned the value of clean, modular code with clear naming conventions, which greatly improves readability and maintainability. Focusing on writing adaptable code also allowed for easier future modifications and scalability. I now prioritize these qualities in my programming to create software that’s easier to review, update, and optimize.
